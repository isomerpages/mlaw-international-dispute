The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is now into its 6th year. It is a strategic initiative that connects governments and businesses, and facilitates trade and investment. BRI projects often involve cross-border, high-value, and long-term investments. To help projects progress smoothly and preserve relationships, it is key to prevent and address any issues that may arise, in accordance with the rule of law. Protecting the legal rights of all parties equally will help create a stable, fair and transparent business environment built on the rule of law.

* How can we work together to develop a dispute resolution mechanism to support the BRI?
* How can parties resolve disputes efficiently, quickly, and amicably?
* How can companies best fulfil their legal and dispute resolution needs?

The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) and the Singapore Ministry of Law will be organizing a Singapore-China International Dispute Resolution Conference to discuss these issues.

The Conference will bring together more than 200 legal and dispute resolution practitioners, C-suite executives, in-house counsel and government officials from Singapore and China, to discuss these issues and more.

Singapore Senior Minister of State for Law and Health Mr Edwin Tong SC and a senior representative from CCPIT will be the Guests of Honour. Speakers will include prominent representatives from the CCPIT and Singapore dispute resolution institutions, as well as Chinese and Singapore law firms.

We look forward to your participation in the 2019 China-Singapore International Dispute Resolution Conference!
